**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** September 30, 2024  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

The Global GMP/GDP Risk Assessment Tool is a comprehensive web-based application designed specifically for the pharmaceutical industry to manage risks associated with medicine transportation in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Distribution Practice (GDP) guidelines.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework:** React 19.1.0 with functional components and hooks architecture provides a robust foundation for building interactive user interfaces.

**Routing:** React Router DOM 7.6.1 enables seamless navigation between different sections of the application.

**UI Components:** The application leverages shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives.

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.1.7 offers utility-first styling approach.

**Data Visualization:** Recharts 2.15.3 provides interactive charts and graphs for risk analysis.

**State Management:** React Context API manages application-wide state for authentication, risk data, and regulatory references.

## Core Features Implementation

### User Authentication and Authorization

The authentication system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model with three distinct user roles:

**Administrator Role:** Full system access including user management capabilities and audit trail monitoring.

**Risk Assessor Role:** Can create, modify, and delete risk entries while accessing the dashboard and regulatory references.

**Viewer Role:** Read-only access to the dashboard and regulatory references.

### Risk Management System

The risk management module provides comprehensive CRUD operations for pharmaceutical transportation risks with standardized risk scoring methodology where risk score equals likelihood multiplied by impact.

### Interactive Dashboard

The dashboard provides comprehensive visualization through multiple chart types including KPIs, risk distribution analysis, mitigation status tracking, trend analysis, and risk heatmaps.

### Regulatory References Library

Comprehensive library of GMP and GDP guidelines with advanced search capabilities and direct linking to risk assessments.

### Audit Trail System

Complete change tracking for all risk assessment modifications ensuring regulatory compliance and accountability.
